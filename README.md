# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2022 solutions repository! [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is an annual event in which a series of small programming puzzles are released each day from December 1st through December 25th.

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 puzzles. I have solved the puzzles using the JavaScript programming language.

## How to Run the Solutions

To run the solutions, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can run the solution script using the following command:

```
node day-25/part-1.js
```

The solutions are tested to work with Node.js 16.x, but they should also work with other versions of Node.js.

I hope you enjoy my solutions! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
